\section{The New Rules}
\subsection{Life is Negotiation}
Negotiation is everywhere and is nothing more than communication with results. First step in negotiation mastery is to get over aversion to it as it is how the world works.

\section{Be a Mirror}

\subsection{Assumptions Blind, Hypotheses Guide}
Engage negotiation with goal of extracting as much information as possible, formulate hypotheses to what they want and test them.

\subsection{Calm the Schizophrenic}
It is very hard to listen well. Our minds engage in selective listening. Do not approach a negotiation being preoccupied with arguments for your side that you are unable to listen attentively. Instead of doing any thinking to what your arguments are, make sole and all-encompassing focus on other person and what they have to say.

Next is to figure out what counterpart actually need (monetairly, emotionally, etc). Can only do this once they are feel save enough to talk about it. First step is actively listen. Second is get down to true motives.

\subsection{Slow. It. Down.}
Going too fast is a common mistake that leaves couterpart feel like they're not being heard. Slow down leads to calm down.

\subsection{The Voice}
Three types of voices: late-night FM DJ, postive/playful, diect/assertive. Most of the time use positive/playful voice. Key is to relax and smile when talking -- counterpart will pick up on that and become more positive and likely to collaborate. Use late-night FM DJ voice by inflecting voice downward and talkking slowly and clearly.
